        My family is very important to me. We do lots of things together. My
        brothers and I like to go on long walks in the mountains. My sister
        likes to cook with my grandmother. On the weekends we all play board
        games together. We laugh and always have a good time. I love my family
        very much.

        I live in a house near the mountains. I have two brothers and one
        sister, and I was born last. My father teaches mathematics, and my
        mother is a nurse at a big hospital.

        I play outside. I like to play. I read a book. I like to read books. I
        walk home. I do not like walking home. My mother cooks soup for dinner.
        The soup is hot. Then, I go to bed. I do not like to go to bed.
